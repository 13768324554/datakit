??? delegates -> need to read the CIEL paper again.

### user-defined tasks

Should be opam-oriented.

/task/:id/value {
  user: "GitHub name"
  date:
  query:
  kind: [user|GH|...]
}

/task/:id/status
/task/:id/jobs/:id

The GitHub watches should resolve in creating new task in there.

The tasks are translated into jobs by the 'solver' worker.

### jobs with input/outputs

Should be opam-agnostic

/jobs/:id/value {
  inputs: [:ids]
  env: [..]
  cmd: [
    [opam switch <comp>] (or untar compiler?)
    ([untar x_1 in dir/] ||
     ...
     [untar x_n in dir/] )
    [opam intall-one pkg.version]
  ]
  host: `uname -a`
  kind: [delegate | action]
} -- id is hash of the value

/jobs/:id/outputs {
  stdout : "http://.." + SHA + sign
  stderr : "http://.."
  archive: "http://.."
}

/jobs/:id/status
/jobs/:id/tasks/:id


### worker

/worker/:id/value {
  host:
  name:
  ip:
}

### scheduler

/scheduler/pending
/scheduler/running
/scheduler/
